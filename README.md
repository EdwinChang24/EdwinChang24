# 👋 Hi, I'm Edwin

I'm a curious developer always looking at the newest and coolest stuff. Modern software development should be easy and fun for everyone.

## 🧑‍💻 Programming Languages

I've done plenty of Python, Java, and Kotlin, and I have some experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their variants. I'm familiar with the Android ecosystem. Rust looks very interesting, as well as the V language.

## 🤖 Robotics

I'm a member of FRC Team 1678: Citrus Circuits, where I've mostly done programming. Check out our website [here](https://www.citruscircuits.org/).
