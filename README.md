# 👋 Hi, I'm Edwin

I'm a curious developer always looking at the newest and coolest tech. I believe that modern software development should be easy and fun for everyone.

I'm currently a freshman at UC Santa Barbara's College of Creative Studies, where I'm majoring in Computing.

## 🧑‍💻 My Work

I currently specialize in Kotlin, and I have experience working with the modern Android ecosystem as well as Kotlin Multiplatform. I'm also familiar with web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their variants. Other languages I've worked with include Python, Java, and C++, and I'm currently interested in learning Rust and Haskell.

## 🤖 Robotics

I'm an alum of [FRC Team 1678: Citrus Circuits](https://www.citruscircuits.org), on which I've designed and implemented Android and desktop apps for a robot scouting system to perform strategic data analysis on teams' performance at competitions. Check out [our scouting system whitepaper from last season](https://www.citruscircuits.org/uploads/6/9/3/4/6934550/whitepaper_2024_-_final.pdf).
